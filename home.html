        <h2>One Earth</h2>
        <p>We only have one earth and 7 billion people living on it. In recent decades, humanity has been contributing to the loss of ecosystems due to deforestation and pollution. We could be responsible for a mass extinction of animal and plant life on the planet within the next generation and If we do not act fast enough, there will be no turning back. Through deforestation, we destroy the homes of many animal species for our own benefit. Through pollution, we are releasing carbon dioxide from our vehicles and in to the atmoshpere, which causes the global temparature of the air and ocean to rise. We are also releasing plastic waste into the ocean, causing many marine wildlife to be destroyed. Many scientist from the world agree that we are the primary cause of global warming and climate change. </p>
        <p>Not all is lost yet, as there are many organisations that are doing everything they can in order to save the planet and protect local environment and ecosystems. Below are four organisations that are solving the current world problems in their own way and they will also provide anyone who interested something to remeber that they have helped in saving the planet.</p>
