          <h3>Story and Mission</h3>
          <p>In 2016, Kevin McCroary traveled to the Philippines to serve underprivileged children. It was an experience that allowed him to personally witness the polluted conditions that these children had been born into. This journey allowed him to truly see the impact humanity can have on the earth. After studying the effect of climate change on the environment and started planning a trip to visit the Arctic to witness the effect of climate change.</p>
          <p> He arrived in the Arctic after a recent tsunami and he met a group of refugees who lost their homes to the tsunami. One of the refugees, Remy, kept a daily journal of the weather conditions for the last 35 years and noticed that the temperature was getting warmer as a result of the changing climate. This trip solidified that climate change was a reality to people living in the Arctic and the world.</p>
          <p>After he returned, it was clear to him that something had to be done and he decide to work on something that will a positive impact on the planet. He wanted to create a brand that will encourage people to "follow your legend",meaning to follow the path your heart is calling to take and leave a legacy on the planet. He decide to launch "Legend Bracelet". </p>
          <p>The organisation's mission is to educate people about climate change through a consumer product and introduce them to issues such as thawing permafrost and scientific organizations conducting research to help protect the environment.</p>
