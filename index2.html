          <h3>What is Gone West?</h3>
          <p>Gone West is a tree planting company. Since the company started in 2013, over 4 million trees have been planted, but that’s just the beginning. The comanpanies goal is to create environmental and social benefits around the world by creating generate ethical, green, jobs and help to establish, or restore, natural habitats. Whether you are a concerned citizen or a multi-national enterprise,  the company is there to help you balance your environmental footprint and make your world a little greener.</p>
          <h3>The first planting</h3>
          <p>The company began with James Hughes, who began to plant trees while working with the timber industry. When he strated planting, he thought that he was able to make a change because trees are worth much more than they are weighed in wood. James would often employ short term workers to help him plant trees during rainy seasons. Along the way, James decided to go independent and formed the coompany with some of those workers to focus on helping the ecosystem With a team of 150 planters, and 12 people running the behind the scene's stuff, the company is working together on one big dream, to make this world a little smaller and much more green.</p>

        <div id="operation-info">
          <p>On average, every human being produces 12 tonnes of Co2 per year. One tree is able, through its lifetime, to offset and store 1 tonne of Co2. the company is offering you is the opportunity to purchase as many trees as necessary to balance the equation. We are going to plant and protect those trees on your behalf contributing towards a more sustainable future for everybody.</p>
          <h3>Partners</h3>
          <p>Gone West Global partners with projects around the globe who specialise in eco-restoration and permaculture. They have the land, the know how and the means to properly plant and care for those trees. Usually what they don’t have is a stream of revenue, this is where the company jumps in and helps the local population by providing them with native trees and paid labour.</p>
          <h3>Where are the trees planted?</h3>
          <p>The trees are planted across the world, whenever there are projects that need our help. They are working for social change, they are working for climate justice and often they are working for their lives. Gone West Global supplies them with trees, resources and visibility, because their local cause is our global cause.</p>
          <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
          <p>It’s important because climate change is real. We have drastically underestimated our impact on the planet, leading to the extinction and endangerment of countless species, possibly including our own. In the past two centuries we cut down 50% of the world’s forest, the global temperature has been rising yearly, and the consequences are just under our eyes everyday. Their aim is not only to nourish the planet but also human connections. Through these trees we believe that we can create bonds that will transcend borders and beliefs.</p>

          <p>When you purchase your tree or subscribe to a subscription you can pick which project you want to support and we will send you the coordinates and more info about your trees new home. Depending on the subscription, you can choose how many trees can be planted. Gone Wild also created an application, Green Light, which tracks how much you have travelled and it converts them to the amount of trees that will be planted in your name. If you own a company, you can choose how your company can make a positive impact on the planet.</p>
          <p> It is possible that you can also plant a tree by yourself but that is only possible if there is a project near you or if you choose to travel to a project somewhere in the world.</p>
