          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Alex Schulze and Andrew Cooper have been around the ocean their entire lives. After college, the two friends saved up enough mone to go on a surfing trip to Bali. When they arrived, they found a beach that was completely covered in plastic, with trash-filled waves delivering more garbage with each wave. They asked a local why such a popular, and otherwise beautiful, shoreline wasn’t kept clean, and were told that the beaches had been cleaned just hours earlier. The trash they were wading through had only just washed ashore. Their eyes were immediately opened to the magnitude of the ocean plastic crisis, and they decided to do something about it.</p>
          <p>Alex and Andrew decided to hire boat captains and other local workers to clean the ocean and coastlines full time. In order to make the biggest impact on this global problem, they launched their efforts in places like Bali where a lot of plastic and other garbage regularly accumulates.</p>
          <p>Inspired by successful lifestyle brands that were able to build passionate followings, they decided to implement a business model that would allow them to grow quickly so they could pay workers, fund cleanups, and spread the word about the ocean plastic crisis.</p>

          <h3>Goal and Objectives</h3>
          <p>4ocean is a public benefit corporation made up of passionate and hard-working educators, researchers, and action-takers who are fighting every single day to end the ocean plastic crisis. The organisation's belief is that business can be a force for good and that the single actions of individual people, collectively, have the power to change the world.</p>
          <p>The organanisation recruits and employs full-time captains and crews to recover harmful marine debris that’s already polluting the ocean, rivers, and coastlines. The organisation also works to stop plastic pollution at its source by educating people about this global crisis and empowering them to end their dependence on single-use plastic.</p>

          <h3>Clean-up and Recycle</h3>
          <p>4oceans takes their cleanup operations seriously and always go the extra mile to ensure our crews are maximizing their impact. The organsiation also documents each cleaning operation and tracks every singele pound that they have picked up. Each cleanup crew follows a step by step process that is verified by the Better Business Bureau.</p>
          <p> The clean-up process is as follows: 1. A photo is taken of the days cleaning crew. 2. A second photo is taken, which is the polluted area that is being cleaned. 3. Photos can be taken during the cleaning. 4. Once the cleanup is complete, a photo is taken of the area. 5. All recovered plastic is packed into bags for documentation and transport. 6. Each bag is weighed individually and documented on a Daily Trash Tracker Sheet. 7. All of the bags are collected by the collection crews and transported to local fascilities for sorting and recycling.</p>
          <p> Once it’s weighed, photographed, and documented, our recovered ocean plastic is transported to our regional operational bases where it’s sorted by type, color, and condition before being sent to our recycling partners for washing, flaking, and pelletizing. These pellets are then used to manufacture new and existing 4ocean products like our Signature iPhone Cases and Bracelets. </p>
          <p> While recycling is always our highest priority, there are certain materials that are just too contaminated, deterioried, or otherwise not feasible to recycle in certain countries. When this happens, the organisation partners with various local facilities to find the most sustainable method of disposal. After all other methods of recycling are exhausted, 4ocean is sometimes forced to dispose of the materials through thermal treatment, which is the conversion of trash to electricity, or by responsibly landfilling the materials. </p>

        <div id="product-info">
          <p>After all of the plastic has been recycled and converted into pellets, they are manufactured into a large variety of reusable products, such as shopping bags, beach chairs, beach umbrellas, bracelets and phonecases. Some products are manufactured from natural materials such as cotton, bamboo and even stainless steel as those materials can be bought once and can be cleaned quickly.</p>
          <p>When a product is bought from their website, the funds are directly used to remove one pound of plastic from the ocean and its coastlines. When purchasing a bracelet, some of the funds are used to create sustainable, living wage jobs for locals who are unable to find employment due to limited job oppurtunities. This way locals are able to  assemble the bracelets by hand in their own homes and are able to sustain themselves and their families. </p>
